If you wish to deploy your own version, the easiest way is to use the docker images, which can be found on Docker Hub:

## APIs

If you would like to use Many Decks' data for your application, we welcome that, but please do get in contact before 
directing any non-trivial (i.e: other than testing) load on us, as currently we don't expect anyone to depend on 
the service, so it may cause issues for our servers, and we may change the API under your feetâ€”breaking your 
application.

## Contributing

If you have any problems with the editor, please [raise an issue][issue]. If you would like to help develop it, pull
requests are welcome.
